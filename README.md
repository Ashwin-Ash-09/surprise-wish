## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ashwin-Ash-09/surprise-wish.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd surprise-wish
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

### Development

To run the application in development mode with hot-reloading, use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start a development server, usually at `http://localhost:5173`. In development mode, the application will use the configuration from `public/config.json` if it exists, otherwise it will fall back to the default configuration in `src/config.js`.

### Production

To build the application for production, use the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a `dist` folder with the optimized production-ready files. To preview the production build, you can use the following command:

```bash
npm run preview
```

This will serve the `dist` folder locally.

## Customization

This project is designed to be highly customizable, even after it has been built.

### Production Customization (Recommended)

After you have built the project, you can customize it by editing the `dist/config.json` file directly. This allows you to create multiple variations of the surprise without rebuilding the application each time.

The workflow is as follows:

1.  Build the project once: `npm run build`.
2.  Open the `dist/config.json` file and edit the values to personalize the surprise.
3.  Serve the `dist` directory using a static file server, or deploy it to a web hosting service.

When the application is loaded in a browser, it will fetch the `dist/config.json` file and use its values to configure the surprise. If the `dist/config.json` file is not found, it will fall back to the default configuration from `src/config.js`.

### Configuration Options

The following table lists all the available customization options in the `config.json` file:

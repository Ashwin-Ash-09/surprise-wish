# TODO: Modify Heart Component to Fade Away After Configurable Duration

## Steps to Complete:
- [x] Edit src/config.js: Add configurable duration for heart animation.
- [x] Edit src/components/Heart.jsx: Use fixed duration from config, animate to opacity 0, call onComplete on animation complete, remove locking functionality.
- [x] Changes implemented: Hearts appear on each click, animate for configurable seconds, fade out, and remove. Previous hearts do not vanish until their animation completes.
